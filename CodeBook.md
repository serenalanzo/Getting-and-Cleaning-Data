TIDY DATA SET DESCRIPTION:

This Code Book is created to describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

VARIABLES: The tidy data set contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity. 
The tidy data set includes only the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation. The variable units are the following: 

    Activity variable: factor;
    Subject variable: integer;
    All the other variables: numeric.
 
DATA: As I said, data were averaged based on the activity and the subject. 
The activity coulumn is composed by six type: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING. 
The subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. 
The tidy data contains 180 rows (6 activity multiplied for 30 subject) and 68 columns (66 variables and activity labels) 
which are listed below:
